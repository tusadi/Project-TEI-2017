This is a Unity3d project for implementation of Mixed Reality. The Unity Package includes everything you will need.
Light saber controller is just a cube made out of cardboard and the Qr code pasted will be included in the folder itself(refer to the Qr_image). 
2.For the haptic feedback to work you will need to install websocket-Python and need to run the websocketserver.py .
Other than that you are good to go, there's also an APK of the Game Build included namely ar_survival_net2.05.
